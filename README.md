# *_Comparing small subunit rRNA gene coverage between metagenomics and total RNA sequencing using a microbial mock community_*
This project represents the second chapter of my PhD, in which I compare metagenomics and total RNA-Seq in terms of their small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene coverage and further test the impact of data-processing tools on coverage.
The repo contains scripts to run data-processing pipelines, to determine coverages, and for statistical analysis.

The results are to be published in a paper.
